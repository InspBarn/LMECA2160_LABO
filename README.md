# LMECA2160_LABO
The LMECA2160 course at UCLouvain learns students about fuel composition and their combustion processes. They are invited to achieve a laboratory during which they handle a combustion of a gas and compare theory with their experimentation. Please refer to the .pdf file for more details.
